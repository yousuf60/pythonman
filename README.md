# pythonman
app that you can edite inside 
### this app is made especially for phones
it's recommended to edite source codes in another editore by copy & past
### you can use 'printf' method as using print or MDLabel but you cant use it with alot of lines in the same string or huge string so you will need to make a 'for loop' for each line better

when you press 'save' the app will check the syntax only and if there is an syntax errore you cant save the code
#### you are free to edite in the app as you want and also you can make your own app or test it by editing the main code inside the app
# if you have a big problime you are free to delete my app HAHA ^.^
